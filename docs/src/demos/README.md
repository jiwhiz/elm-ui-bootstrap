# Demos

The Navbar and Pagination modules all need the entire model-view-update to function, and thus I've given the user the full Main.elm code, as well as the Index.html code to use as a demo.

This folder stores these demos because I had to compile them to make sure they ran correctly.

P.s. [NavbarTestSimple.elm](NavbarTestSimple.elm), for me at least, kinda screws elm-analyze up for some reason, making it not able to parse the file. It does run smoothly and the code works so idk what's happening there.
